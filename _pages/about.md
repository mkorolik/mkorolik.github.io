Hello! I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Astronomy and Astrophysics at KU Leuven. I graduated from Yale University in 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Astrophysics and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.  

I'm primarily interested in stellar astrophysics. For my undergraduate thesis, I created and analyzed MESA evolutionary models of RR Lyrae to inverstigate the impact of convective boundary mixing on their non-radial pulsations. Previously, I've worked with optical interferometry data to obtain stellar parameters of sun-like stars. 

I'm originally from San Jose, California! My hobbies include piano, knitting/crocheting/embroidery, and hiking :)
